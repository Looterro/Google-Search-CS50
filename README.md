# Google-Search-CS50
Google Search CS50 2022 Project 0

Project is based on Project 0, which is part of CS50 2022 Harvard open course. It contains three pages - google search, google image search and google advanced search.

On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
Like Google’s own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and should be beneath the search bar.
On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options):

-Find pages with… “all these words:”
-Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
-Find pages with… “any of these words:”
-Find pages with… “none of these words:”

Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options are stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.
Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button is blue with white text.
When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.
Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
